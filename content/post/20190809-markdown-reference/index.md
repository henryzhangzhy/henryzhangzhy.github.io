A reference for markdown language.

structure

# title \#
## second level title \#\#

### list
- a '\-' followed by a space
- a '\-' another one

1. numbered list
3. actual number doesn't matter, just a number

   properly indented paragraph, with blank line and space.
   - another sublist
   - here
   * \* works for unordered lists
   + \+ works the same
   - \- as well
2. checked box
   - [ ] unchecked
   - [x] checked

### format

- _emphasis_: \_emphasis\_ or \*emphasis\*
- __strong emphasis__: \_\_strong emphasis\_\_ or \*\*strong emphasis\*\*
- **combined _emphasis_**: \*\*combined \_emphasis\_\*\*
- ~~strike through~~: \~\~strike through\~\~
- a new line in editor will result in no line break in the markdown display.
- insert an empty to get a new paragraph
- add <br\/> to the end of the line to get a new line. a single back slash \\ works for markdown but not generated website and double backslashes \\\\ works for a website but not markdown. Double space works for both but is not recommanded as editors sometimes delete them while saving.

### code
