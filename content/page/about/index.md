## About Me

Hengyuan Zhang is a Ph.D. student at the CSE Department of UCSD. He is a member of the [Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory](http://avl.ucsd.edu/) with [Prof. Henrik I. Christensen](http://www.hichristensen.net/). He earned his master’s degree in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control at the ECE Department of UCSD and Bachelor’s degree in Automation at Nanjing University. His research is in online mapping and sensor fusion in Autonomous Driving. He is part of the founding team in the Autonomous Vehicle Lab and has worked on semantic mapping, online mapping, LiDAR based detection, tracking and lidar-camera fusion for object tracking at AVL. He is excited about using robotics technologies to make human lives better.
