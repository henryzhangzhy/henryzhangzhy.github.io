## About Me

Hengyuan Zhang is a Ph.D. student at the CSE Department of UCSD. He is a member of the [Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory](http://avl.ucsd.edu/) with [Prof. Henrik I. Christensen](http://www.hichristensen.net/). He earned his master’s degree in Intelligent Systems, Robotics and Control at the ECE Department of UCSD and Bachelor’s degree in Automation at Nanjing University. His research is in online mapping and sensor fusion in Autonomous Driving. He is part of the founding team in the Autonomous Vehicle Lab and has worked on semantic mapping, online mapping, LiDAR based detection, tracking and lidar-camera fusion for object tracking at AVL. He is excited about using robotics technologies to make human lives better.

## Homepage Thanks to Hugo

Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the [Apache License 2.0.](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/LICENSE) Hugo supports TOML, YAML and JSON data file types, Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes to add rich content. Other notable features are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.

Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
